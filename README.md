# Final Project â€“ Self Assessment

## Roles and Support of Team Members
Throughout the Final Project I mostly served in the X role.  In the first week I created the initial technologies markdown, with collaboration from the team.  In the second week I created mock Dashboards and started the Google slides presentation, as well as updated the repository README file.  I also researched and found the documentation for the Machine Learning ARIMA model.  In the third week I made updates to the Google slides presentation, collaborated on visualizations.  I tested the machine learning model, but was unable to get the database to link. In the fourth week, I reviewed all Project components and made final updates to the presentation.  Throughout the Project, I also maintained notes from our team ZOOM meetings, and sought to ensure the team had clear, concise, and achievable actions and objectives.

My teammates were highly motivated and excited about the opportunity to explore data about the COVID-19 crisis.  However, there were a few brief moments, when the Project felt overwhelming.  Our aspirations were extremely high, but when we ran into barriers we were always able to reset and find a path forward.  Personally, the greatest challenge was time availability.  I feel very fortunate to have been placed with the individuals that make up the COVID Killers, and we worked so well together, we never fell behind schedule and after the first two weeks, we were in a very good position to deliver against the Project objectives and requirements.  Our schedules synced up well, where most group activity was conducted on weekends.  My teammates made the Project run smoothly.

## Team Assessment
Our team communicated through Slack channel, emails, and held ZOOM meetings in addition to scheduled class meetings.  We maintained clear roles and deliverables and discussed any barriers.  We reviewed the weekly deliverable rubrics, and clarified any actions needed to meet the requirements.  Everyone took ownership of their roles and supported each other.  We were a great team.  Doug, Christina, and Sam are amazing. 

## Summary of Project
Our Final Project explored the impacts of COVID-19 on California.  We sought to predict the future cases in California for July 2020, as well as provide data insights into the pandemic regarding risk factors within each California county.  We developed an ARIMA, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average machine learning model using daily new cases, and were able to achieve an 81% accuracy.  The model predicted that cases would trend up in July.  Additionally, we provided a wide array of data applications in a Tableau dashboard for visitors/users to explore and make data guided determinations about their own risk.
